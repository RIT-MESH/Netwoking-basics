# **Networking Cables, Connectors, Switches, and Routers**

## **1. Twisted Pair Cables**
Twisted pair cables consist of pairs of wires twisted together to reduce electromagnetic interference. They are commonly used in Ethernet networking and connect to **switches and routers**.

### **Types of Twisted Pair Cables:**
1. **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)** – Common in LANs (Ethernet) for connecting computers, switches, and routers.
2. **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)** – Used in environments with high interference.
3. **Foiled Twisted Pair (FTP)** – Similar to STP but with overall shielding.
4. **S/FTP (Shielded Foil Twisted Pair)** – Provides maximum protection against interference.

### **Common Categories of Twisted Pair Cables:**
| Category | Speed & Bandwidth | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Cat 3** | 10 Mbps | Used in telephone networks |
| **Cat 5** | 100 Mbps | Used in older Ethernet networks |
| **Cat 5e** | 1 Gbps | Most commonly used in home networks to connect routers and switches |
| **Cat 6** | 10 Gbps (up to 55m) | Used in modern high-speed networks with switches |
| **Cat 6a** | 10 Gbps (up to 100m) | Enhanced shielding for longer distances in data centers |
| **Cat 7** | 10+ Gbps | Used in data centers with shielding for switches and routers |
| **Cat 8** | 25-40 Gbps | Used in high-speed data centers for direct switch-to-switch connections |

### **Common Connectors for Twisted Pair Cables:**
1. **RJ45 (Registered Jack 45)** – Standard connector for Ethernet cables used in switches and routers.
2. **RJ11** – Used for telephone connections.
3. **GG45** – Used in Cat 7 networks with switches.
4. **Tera Connector** – Used in high-speed shielded twisted pair (STP) networks.

## **2. Coaxial Cables**
Coaxial cables consist of a central conductor, an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and an outer insulating layer. Used in **router uplinks** for broadband connections.

### **Types of Coaxial Cables:**
1. **RG-6** – Used for cable TV, satellite, and broadband internet routers.
2. **RG-11** – Used for long-distance network connections.
3. **RG-59** – Used for short-distance video transmission.

### **Common Connectors for Coaxial Cables:**
1. **BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman)** – Used in CCTV and radio communications.
2. **F-Type** – Used for cable TV and broadband internet routers.
3. **N-Type** – Used in wireless antennas and military applications.

## **3. Fiber Optic Cables**
Fiber optic cables use light to transmit data at high speeds over long distances. They connect to **switches and routers in data centers and backbone networks**.

### **Types of Fiber Optic Cables:**
1. **Single-mode fiber (SMF)** – Used for long-distance high-speed data transmission in backbone routers.
2. **Multi-mode fiber (MMF)** – Used for shorter distances and lower bandwidth applications in switch connections.

### **Common Connectors for Fiber Optic Cables:**
1. **SC (Subscriber Connector)** – Push-pull type used in data center switches and routers.
2. **LC (Lucent Connector)** – Compact and widely used in networking.
3. **ST (Straight Tip)** – Used in multimode fiber applications.
4. **FC (Ferrule Connector)** – Used in high-vibration environments.
5. **MTP/MPO (Multi-Fiber Push On)** – Used in high-density switch connections.

## **4. Serial and Console Cables**
These cables are used for direct device management and communication with **routers and switches**.

### **Types of Serial and Console Cables:**
1. **RS-232** – Used for serial communication between networking devices such as routers and switches.
2. **Cisco Console Cable (Rollover Cable)** – Used to configure Cisco routers and switches.

### **Common Connectors:**
1. **DB9** – Used for serial communication in switches and routers.
2. **DB25** – Used in older serial connections.
3. **USB-to-RJ45 Console Cable** – Used for direct switch and router configuration.

## **5. Power over Ethernet (PoE) Cables**
PoE cables provide both data and electrical power over Ethernet cables for **PoE switches and routers**.

### **Common PoE Connectors:**
1. **Standard RJ45** – Used with PoE-compatible switches and routers.
2. **Ethernet PoE Injector** – Used to add PoE capability to non-PoE routers and switches.
